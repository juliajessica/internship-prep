## <span style="color:#74875d;">Self Assessment</span>
#### Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?

* I think I could use go over a few of terms we've learned over the last few months and refresh the use the terminology as I discuss code with other students and teachers.

* I also think I could use a little more practice writing more algorithmic logic such as doing more white-boarding and problem solving.

#### Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?

* I'd like to feel a little more comfortable talking about code with others and not stumbling over my words. I tend to feel nervous when I talk about things that I'm still not 100% comfortable with. I think it would be beneficial to continue verbally talk though my code and discuss my thought process with others.

* I'm confident with my cover letter and resume but, I feel like I can fine tune discussing technical terms/languages/logic, etc... I have a tendency of feeling overwhelmed and not qualified so I want to make sure that I don't push myself too hard and feel more confident than anxious.

I feel very confident that I'm caught up with most of my to-do list and ready for the next track. I've already received two emails back about internships and even though they're not positive leads, they are still connections and possible future opportunities.

I'm finished with my resume, cover letter, Linkedin account, 80% Github account, still working on my React Udemy Course.
